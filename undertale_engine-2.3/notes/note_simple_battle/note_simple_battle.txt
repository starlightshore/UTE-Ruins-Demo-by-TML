If you want to try this example,
Goto the default view, and move the [room_simple_battle] below [room_init].

Create your own encounter group in the script [Encounter_Custom],
and then use [Encounter_Start(id)] to start a battle.

In the creation code of [room_simple_battle],
we wrote a line of code to start the battle when the room loads.

When creating an enemy/turn/bullet object,
always select the parent object first!
