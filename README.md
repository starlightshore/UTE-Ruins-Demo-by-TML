RUINS DEMO
--
TML made this Ruins Demo but lost the source code. However, a .exe was found!
Using UndertaleModTool I decompiled the .exe and remade the whole demo.
Demo contains the first 5 rooms of undertale, minus the Flowey fight.
This Demo is for studying how to use the UNDERTALE ENGINE only.
Credit to TML for creating both the engine and this demo.
