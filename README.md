TML made this Ruins Demo but lost the source code. However, a .exe was found! This is my recreation using the decompiled code/assets.
This uses TML's UNDERTALE Engine, made using GameMaker Studio 2.2
Join our discord server (will be link provided later) to help learn the engine. Documentation and examples are still in development by the discord admins. A Godot Deltarune Engine with UT capabilities is in development by TML. Proper credit must be done when using this engine.

current bugs:
trigger warp glitching
toriel x-coordinate movement is off (maybe origin issue?)
needs portrait fixing (Flowey and Toriel portraits)
vents decompile error makes it impossible to recreate right now
